Original git: https://github.com/blevs/react-timer

## Features

* Create a working timer. It should start counting when the page loads via `useEffect`.
* Track the number of seconds with `useState`.
* Have a 'pause' button stop the timer.
* Have a 'play' button re-start the timer.
* Have a 'reset' button clear and stop the timer.

## What I learned:

* Usage of UseEffect in React, including callback functions & cleanup functions
* The play and pause button are in the same position. They take turns showing up
